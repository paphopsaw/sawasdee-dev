# About me

Hi, welcome to my blog.
My name is Stock Sawasdee. I'm a software engineer in Tokyo. I was born and raised in Bangkok.
I've been studying in the US for 5 years before I moved back to Bangkok in 2018.
While in Bangkok, I was working as a research scientist for a national energy company,
until I moved to Japan in 2023 when I officially started my software engineering career.

Outside of work, I enjoy outdoor activities like running, cycling, and skiing.
